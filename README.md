# AML

Project for the Applied Machine Learning - Basic course. All the code is in a jupyter notebook that has already run to display the results. 
The dataset was imported from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hojjatk/mnist-dataset/data, it is compressed and uploaded here in MNIST.zip for convenience. 

We implement two models to tackle the MNIST classification task: a binary Logistic Regression with a One-vs-Rest approach and a Multinomial Logistic Regression. The models achieve an accuracy of 91.70% and 92.27% respectively on the test dataset.
